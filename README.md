# useless-sh

Useless-SH is the most useless shell ever.

## Commands

- `quit` or `exit` - quit the shell
- `help` - show help

This shell cannot execute any commands or binaries other than those listed.

## Why???

idk

## Building

`go build ./main.go`

This will create a `main` or `main.exe`, which is the Useless-SH executable.
